# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Creating  a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type: Urban, Suburan and Rural. 

## Results
Based on the Pyber Rides Summary data it, reflects that Urban areas have about 3x as many rides as Suburban areas which in turn have about 4x as many rides as Rural areas. The "Totatl Drivers" show although Urban areas have more drivers and total rides, the Average Fare per Ride shows that Rural drivers get $4 more per ride than Suburban which generates about $6 more than Urban.

## Summary
Unsurpisingly, Urban locations have more rides and drivers, most likely, due to population density and general lack of personal vehicles. Rural drivers may be making more as desitiations tend to have more distance than an Urban area. Looking at the chart, it seems prices increase between Feb 2019/Mar 2019 and, in Urban and Suburban areas, continue to inrease through April 2019. Its possible, as the weather warms up, more riders are going out and need transportation.
